# FormToHandlebarjs

Overview -> Collecting data from input form and post the data into Handlerbar js(HTML Template) using React Js, its just a model program for the reference of React js with Handlerbar js.

I used 2 useState(hooks concept) in order to change the data while get new input from user in form which will replace existing data in the table.

Finally When you click print button, It will print Table data as PDF file.
